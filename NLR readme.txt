Info: 
	This is a 'what if Napoleon won?' alternate history scenario, based on IGoR PUIR (an mp mod you can find here https://github.com/Nurse-Reno/IGoR_puir)

Installation: Open your Victoria 2 game files
(if you bought the game on Steam, right click on it in your library, click on properties, then on 'browse local files'), 
open the NLR zip file, 
copy the Napoleon's Legacy Remake folder and Napoleon's Legacy Remake .mod file to the /mod folder in your game files.


The NLR Low Res submod changes the terrain textures to be smaller, so that they have less an impact on performance, while still looking... passable, to me. This submod doesn't change the checksum.
If you don't want to keep having to click on the submod in the launcher, you can just copy the files of it into the main mod folder.

The Victoria 2 Modding Server and all the people in it: for all the help. By the way, to any modders: you're free to take parts of this mod and do your own thing with it. Even the PUIR parts, I'm sure all the 4 currently absent PUIR developers won't care about you taking their code. It'd be cool if you didn't take the entire mod and reupload it under your own name, but I don't know why you'd want to do that in the first place.
