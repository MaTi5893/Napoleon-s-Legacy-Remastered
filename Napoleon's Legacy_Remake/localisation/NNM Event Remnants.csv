EVTNAME2600;$STATENAME$ Integration;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC2600;$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole. There are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags waving in $PROVINCENAME$, flown by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, so it does not seem so far-fetched an idea that $STATENAME$ be eventually considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory by the world at large.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x,,,
EVTNAME2601;Integration Cancelled in $STATENAME$;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC2601;There is no longer a need to integrate $STATENAME$, since it is already our core land.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVT2601OPTA;So be it.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTNAME2605;$PROVINCENAME$ Integrated into $COUNTRY$;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC2605;$COUNTRY$ has controlled $PROVINCENAME$ for a long time-- long enough for those within $PROVINCENAME$ to truly consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and for the rest of the world to consider the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to the province to be legitimate as well. Though there are still some unhappy with the development, $PROVINCENAME$ is now considered an integral part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x,,,
