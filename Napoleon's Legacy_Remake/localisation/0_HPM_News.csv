There is no word of a reaction from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government as of yet, but it is clear that many are urging for some kind of action. 'Should $COUNTRY$ do nothing? I think not!';;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTDESC60000_NEWS_LONG;Speaking from government offices in $CAPITAL$, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leadership announced today that the communist party would be suspending voting rights and restricting reforms 'to combat the current crisis'. While government ministers reassured many that the measures would be temporary, it appears obvious to outsiders that this is but the first step in the transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a dictatorship of the proletariat. Many see this as having always been the goal of the ruling $COUNTRY_ADJ$ communist party: a peaceful overthrow of the current system and the installation of true communist principles.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

The signs are clear and plain: the fascist ruling party has transformed $COUNTRY$ from a democracy into a fascist dictatorship. Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been reported clamping down on protests, black-shirted enforcers visible on every block in every major city.

EVTDESC60060_NEWS_LONG;The political reforms enacted in the past few years have led to a situation where the absolutism of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy can now legitimately be called into question. No longer is the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ king free to dictate the course of the nation to his own musings, but instead has had to accept several constitutional hems and restrictions on his exercise of power. Some question the right of the monarch to override decisions by the newly-elected government, or even refuse to accept the results of an election entirely, but the fact that elections are being permitted at all is considered a sure sign of $COUNTRY$'s democratization.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTDESC11100_NEW;A rising tide of liberal nationalism within $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ has begun to spread, raising the idea of a $UNION_ADJ$ union with $COUNTRY$ at its head. A parliament of liberal revolutionaries has been convened, with representatives from throughout $UNION_ADJ$ lands, which has decreed the time is right for the nation to unite under one banner. The parliament has offered the crown of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ to us. We could accept the offer, but doing so would cause international alarm, and require us to compensate the revolutionaries politically.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
