EVTDESC19300;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she\n' With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor,\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'\n\nThe people of France have presented to the people of our country a spectacular gift. An enormous copper statue, 151 ft. tall, depicting a woman carrying a torch, representing and named 'Liberty Enlightening The World'. The design has been carried out by one Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, and a place has been set aside for the statue on an island near a great harbour. The statue will henceforth be known, simply, as 'The Statue of Liberty'.;;;;;;;x
