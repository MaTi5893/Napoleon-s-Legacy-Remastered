EVTDESC181501;With the help of lobbied Danziger politicians, the Prussian government has assumed power of the City in a blatant violation of the treaties that were signed between our nations. Prussian troops have already been stationed on Danziger land, but we still have the opportunity to act. How should we proceed?;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19300;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she\n' With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor,\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'\n\nThe people of France have presented to the people of our country a spectacular gift. An enormous copper statue, 151 ft. tall, depicting a woman carrying a torch, representing and named 'Liberty Enlightening The World'. The design has been carried out by one Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, and a place has been set aside for the statue on an island near a great harbour. The statue will henceforth be known, simply, as 'The Statue of Liberty'.;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC32509;The feelers put out by Eduard Andreevich Stoeckl have had results, as $FROMCOUNTRY$ has today offered to enter into negotiations over a proposed sale of our territories in North America. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is offering us a price of 2.3 cents per acre for the Alaskan territories, and that price seems relatively fair. The colonies could become hard to defend in the event of war with the United Kingdom, so getting rid of them for a price now might not be such a bad idea. What say you, $MONARCHTITLE$?;;;;;;;x

GC_DESC;A tentative new order reigns in Europe. Napoleon's France defied her enemies and now stands victorious and triumphant in western Europe, with all her rivals greatly humbled. But despite victory, peace did not come cheap - in exchange for lasting peace France agreed to limit her direct rule to lands west of the Rhine, and to grant autonomy to some of her previous subjects. The future is uncertain. Resentful Austrians and Prussians continue to chip away at the fringes of French influence, waiting to see if the young empire falters. And with the growing bubblings of nationalism and increasing industrialization across the continent, internal strife threatens to once again upend peace in Europe. Meanwhile the remnants of the exiled and shattered United Kingdom, with her Native American allies, are locked in a bitter struggle of containment against American expansionism. The outcome of the war could decide the fate of not only North America, but the wider British Empire.;;;;;;;x
