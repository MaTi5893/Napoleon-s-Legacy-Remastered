EVTDESC181501;With the help of lobbied Danziger politicians, the Prussian government has assumed power of the City in a blatant violation of the treaties that were signed between our nations. Prussian troops have already been stationed on Danziger land, but we still have the opportunity to act. How should we proceed?;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19300;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she\n' With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor,\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'\n\nThe people of France have presented to the people of our country a spectacular gift. An enormous copper statue, 151 ft. tall, depicting a woman carrying a torch, representing and named 'Liberty Enlightening The World'. The design has been carried out by one Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, and a place has been set aside for the statue on an island near a great harbour. The statue will henceforth be known, simply, as 'The Statue of Liberty'.;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC32509;The feelers put out by Eduard Andreevich Stoeckl have had results, as $FROMCOUNTRY$ has today offered to enter into negotiations over a proposed sale of our territories in North America. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is offering us a price of 2.3 cents per acre for the Alaskan territories, and that price seems relatively fair. The colonies could become hard to defend in the event of war with the United Kingdom, so getting rid of them for a price now might not be such a bad idea. What say you, $MONARCHTITLE$?;;;;;;;x
