Execute_Bab_desc;The Bab, leader of the Babist movement has for some time been in our possession. Due to recent unrest among the followers of Babism, powerful figures in our court wish to execute him. This will hopefully restore unity to the empire, but might cause short term turmoil.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTNAME999100;Cape Horn;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC999100;Our country is located on the wrong side of the Andes Mountains, which means that for migrants from europe to be able to reach our shores, they will need to traverse the treacherous Cape Horn. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and icebergs. These dangers have made it notorious as a sailors graveyard. For these reasons, we should not expect many migrants will journey to our country.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTOPTA999100;We will prosper regardless!;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

gibraltar_of_paraguay_desc;Near the mouth of the Paraguay river, there is a sharp bend. A strategic site without equal in the region, building a fortress here would allow us to control all passage in and out of our country, and even Mato Grosso. We will build a fortress the likes of which have never been seen in South America, and one day it will be known as the Gibraltar of South America.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
