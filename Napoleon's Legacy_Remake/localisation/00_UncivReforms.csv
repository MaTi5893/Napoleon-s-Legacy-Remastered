vacuum_distillation;Vacuum Distillation;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
vacuum_distillation_desc;Vacuum distillation is a process for separating hydrocarbons using pressure. The liquid hydrocarbons are channeled into the lower portion of the distillation column at a temperature no greater than 370 degrees Celsius at an absolute pressure. The pressure in the column increases gradually from the top of the column to the bottom. The hydrocarbons evaporate and are piped out at various levels whenever the atmospheric pressure above the hydrocarbon to be distilled is lower than its vapor pressure. Vacuum distillation increases the relative volatility of the components, making the separation process quicker.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

montesquieu_desc;Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brede et de Montesquieu was a French lawyer and political philosopher. He was best known for his support of constitutional government with a clear separation of powers. In his most famous work, 'The Spirit of the Laws (1748),' Montesquieu developed a series of classification sytems to describe governments and societies. He divided French society into three classes: the monarchy, the aristocracy and the commons, and he said that they should be equally dependent on and separate from eachother. Government administration was divided into three branches, the executive, legislative, and the judicial. His separation of powers later became embedded in the U.S. and other modern constitutions. He popularized the term 'Despotism' by describing it as one of the three basic forms of government, along with Monarchy and Republic.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

rousseau_desc;Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a French writer and philosopher. Rousseau's many publications provided a central inspiration for the French Revolution. In 'Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men (1754),' Rousseau refuted Hobbes' conception of the Social Contract as being imposed on the masses by the powerful in society, thereby instituting inequality into the civil society. In 'The Social Contract (1762) Rousseau argued against the divine right of monarchs and asserted that sovereignty resides with the people. However, he argued that government must be separate from the legislative power of the sovereignty for the application of laws and that it was the duty of the people to abolish an overreaching government. Under his version of the Social Contract, the people had a right of freedom to withdraw from it except in time of need.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

Its contributors included Diderot himself and most of his leading cotemporaries including Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau. Diderot's support for religious and political freedoms and the importance of modern science and industry was opposed by the aristoratic society in France. His encyclopedia was officially suppressed in 1759 and he had to complete much of the work on his own thereafter.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
immanuel_kant;Immanuel Kant;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
immanuel_kant_desc;Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher, highly influential in many fields such as metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics,and political philosophy. He promoted as a central theme of the Enlightenment the application of reason to sujective experiences in order to derive knowledge. Kant published 'The Critique of Pure Reason (1781)' in which he argued for a 'Copernican revolution' in philosophy. Kant's doctrine became known as Transcendental Idealism. Kant believed that humans do not experience the world in a direct way, but in a phenomenal way using our senses. These experiences are thus purely subjective and incapable of comprehension as they are (in and of themselves) until processed through Reason. He stated that concepts of mathematics, space and time were transcendental. That is, they were necessary preconditions for the possibilities of experience. His theories influenced a wide spectrum of thinkers and scientists within many disciplines.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
david_hume;David Hume;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
david_hume_desc;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian and essayist, highly influential in the fields of empiricism and skepticism. Hume argued in 'A Treatise of Human Nature (1739)' that the psychological basis for human behaviour was desire rather than reason. He rejected the views of Locke that humans were born with innate ideas, believing instead that knowledge is derived solely from direct experience. Hume wrote that moral actions came from passions and were intrisically motivated, rather than derived from Reason. He believed in the compatibility of scientific determinism with the concept of free will. The exercise of liberty in fact requires the uniform physical laws governing the natural world, or else our exercise of free will would be nothing more than an act of chance. Hume influenced a diverse group of contemporary and subsequent writers including William James, Adam Smith and Kant.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

thomas_jefferson_desc;"Thomas Jefferson was one of the 'Founding Fathers' of the United States of America. Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, in which he asserted that all men had ""certain inalienable rights."" He believed in the paramount importance of individual liberties, and argued that liberty should only be limited insofar as it infringed upon the equal rights and liberties of others. Jefferson served as the Third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809 and worked to limit the power of the federal government, favouring decentralisation and protecting the rights of individuals. Jefferson promoted science and education and believed in a wall of separation between church and state.";;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

alexander_bain;Alexander Bain;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
alexander_bain_desc;An associate of J.S. Mill, Alexander Bain added connections from physiology to associationist psychology, adding the laws of compound and constructive association to those of contiguity, similarity, and frequency. He was known for writing two of the earliest textbooks in psychology in 1855 and 1859, which were used by later experimental psychologists such as William James. His Spencer-Bain principle concerning probability of behavior recalls the later Behaviorist school in its conclusions.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
thomas_brown;Thomas Brown;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
thomas_brown_desc;Thomas Brown was an associationist of the Scottish School, he added a secondary set of laws to complete the associationist philosophy. He built upon earlier work by broadening associationism to consider it as an active process of an active mind. This active process considered the effects of other associations, temperament and state of mind of the individual, the state of health of the body, as well as the circumstances of the moment.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
psychological_intelligence;Psychological Intelligence;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
psychological_intelligence_desc;This is the concurrent development to Experimental Psychology that focuses on the use of measurement and mathematics to classify individuals by their development. Beginning with Sir Francis Galton and continuing through Alfred Binet, Charles Spearman, and others, the study of intelligence would produce many different ways of measuring the mental abilities of people. Intelligence theorists would propose methods by which individuals and society could improve itself;;;;x;;;;;;;
francis_galton;Francis Galton;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
francis_galton_desc;"Sir Francis Galton was a British aristocrat who wrote extensively on the measurement of an individual's mental abilities using sensory and motor tests. His 1869 work ""Hereditary Genius:  An Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences"" argued that the children of geniuses tended to become geniuses themselves. He surveyed thousands of fellow academics, publishing in 1874 his findings that intelligence was primarily a heritable trait, although there was some necessity for environmental nurturance of that trait. He was the first to use identical and fraternal twins to measure the effects of nature versus nurture, and established in 1888 the theoretical basis for correlation, scatterplots, and regression as measurement tools.";;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
alfred_binet;Alfred Binet;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
alfred_binet_desc;Alfred Binet was a French psychologist who pioneered the use of standardized testing to measure individual differences in intelligence. The French government commissioned Binet and his student Theodore Simon to develop a test in 1899 to differentiate 'retarded' from 'normal' children. The Simon-Binet test divided intelligence into several areas and measured each with a battery of questions. Questions considered to measure higher ability were those answered more often by students whom their teachers had rated highly. Binet also believed that intelligences were inherited, but improvable by education. His test assigned a single 'mental-level' score to each subject based on their test results.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
charles_spearman;Charles Spearman;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
charles_spearman_desc;Charles Spearman was a British psychologist and mathematician. Spearman criticized Galton's tests as being too simple to measure intelligence. He preferred Binet's test, but criticized the use of a universal number to characterize different areas of intelligence. He developed the process of factor analysis, measuring correlations between performance in different test areas. He proposed two underlying factors 'g' for general intelligence to explain the correlations and 's' for specific abilities to explain the imperfections in his correlations. His 'g'factor was not a concrete number, but he too believed in the heritability of intelligence.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
eugenics;Eugenics;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
eugenics_desc;An outgrowth from Darwinistic ideas on natural selection and trait theories and from the studies in intelligence measurement, Eugenics was concerned with the mental and physical traits found in society and a response to the weaknesses found. Positive eugenics encouraged family programs, social welfare, and the importance of education in the desirability of breeding to increase the appearance of positive traits. Negative eugenics argued for the need to remove weak traits by removing undesirable elements, leading to sterilization and even extermination of target groups.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

edward_titchener_desc;Edward Titchener was an English psychologist who studied under Wundt at Leipzig. Titchener headed the psychology department at Cornell University and founded the Structuralist school, which relied heavily on introspection to perform analysis on the structure of the mind. His attempts to break down experiences into four basic elements was discredited because it was possible for different subjects to identify different elements from the same experiences.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

sigmund_freud;Sigmund Freud;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
sigmund_freud_desc;Sigmund Freud was an Austrian psychologist who founded the discipline of Psychoanalysis. Freud focused on the unconscious mind, dividing it into the id, ego, and superego. Freud believed that unconscious motivations guided the behaviour of his patients and these need to be identified by looking for thoughts and actions that did not fit normal explanation. Manifestation of sexual and aggressive drives were most likely explanations for the differences observed in personality.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
carl_jung;Carl Jung;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
carl_jung_desc;Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and contemporary of Freud. Jung proposed a second, deeper level of collective unconscious, where a number of universal personality types known as archetypes were formed from patterns of emotions and experiences. Jung pioneered dream analysis, arguing that archetypes, complexes and motives manifested themselves through dreams. He was influential in developing the concepts of synchronicity, introversion and extraversion.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
alfred_adler;Alfred Adler;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
alfred_adler_desc;Alfred Adler was an Austrian doctor and psychtherapist. Adler diverged from Freud in arguing that unconscious motivation could be better explained by teleological goals rather than instinctual drives. According to Adler, people are born with a feeling of Inferiority. People attempt to overcome these feelings of inferiority. Adler posited one of three outcomes. An 'inferiority complex' develops in people who are overwhelmed by these feelings. Some of these will develop a superiority complex to mask their true feelings. Psychologically healthy people manifest the concept of self-esteem and satsify their goals through a sense of personal achievement.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

anna_freud_desc;The daughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna began her psychoanalytic practice in 1923. She served as secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association between 1925 and 1934. Freud became known for her work on the social importance of the ego in childhood development. She wrote 'Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense' (1936) in which she further developed the concept of defense mechanisms such as repression, displacement, reaction formation and rationalization. These are mental processes to reduce consciousness of wishes, memories and thoughts that prove threatening to self-esteem and security of the individual.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
karen_horney;Karen Horney;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
karen_horney_desc;Karen Horney was a German psychoanalyst. She came to criticize Freud's emphasis on sex and aggressive as motivating drives. Horney (1937) focused on security instead as the central, inborn human need. In her view, child development was contingent upon parental fulfillment of the child's 'basic anxiety' emotion. Success would result in a trusting individual, while failure would result in insecurity. Insecurity and distrust manifests itself in personality as either avoidance, submission or dominance.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
ivan_pavlov;Ivan Pavlov;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
ivan_pavlov_desc;Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist and winner of the Nobel Prize for his work on reflexes in digestion. In the course of studies with dogs and salivation, Pavlov observed that the dogs elicited a certain type of salivation with certain signals that preceeded the arrival of food. In his 1927 study, Pavlov laid out the basic principles of classical conditioning in Behaviorism. The food was the unconditioned stimulus for salivation. The signal became associated with salivation as a conditioned stimulus, with salivation to the sound of the signal alone becoming the new conditioned response. Extinction, recovery, generalization and discrimination were identified in subsequent studies.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
el_thorndike;Edward L. Thorndike;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
el_thorndike_desc;Edward Lee Thorndike was an American researcher who also conducted experiments in animal learning. He was known for his puzzle-box procedure (1898), in which a hungry cat was placed inside a small cage and observed to see how long it took the cat to learn to pull the lever and escape, where food was waiting. He observed that after 20-30 trials, the cats had become efficient at escaping almost instantaneously. Thorndike formulated the law of effect, stating that responses producing a positive effect became more likely to occur again, and those producing discomfort were less likely to occur again. These observations were later transformed by B.F. Skinner into the concept of operant conditioning in psychology.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
jb_watson;John B. Watson;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
jb_watson_desc;John Broadus Watson was an American psychologist who studied Pavlovian conditioning in humans. Watson's most famous experiment involved conditioning an 11-year old child named Albert to associate a conditioned stimulus (fear of rats) to an unconditioned stimulus (fear of a loud hammering sound). Watson's research later led to clinical treatments extinguishing irrational fears in people. After being dismissed from Harvard over an affair and marriage with a graduate student, Watson brought his research experience to a prominent advertising firm;;;;x;;;;;;;
ec_tolman;Edward C. Tolman;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
ec_tolman_desc;Edward C. Tolman was another prominent American psychologist in the field of Behaviorism. Tolman performed maze experiments to demonstrate latent learning in animals. He showed that a rat could run the maze on the first try, if it was previously allowed to explore the maze while not hungry. Tolman evinced that the subject learned useful stimulus information about the world without reference to a reinforcing stimulus (the food). The ability to run the maze correctly on trial one demonstrated flexibility in the use of the learned information. Tolman's stimulus-stimulus (S-S) learning was opposed by the stimulus-response (S-R) orthodoxy of Skinner.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

auguste_comte_desc;Isidore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier Comte was a french philosopher who founded the political and philosophical movement known as Positivism. He is best known for his six-volume work 'TheCourse on Positive Philosophy (1830-1842)' in which he described a law of three stages in the development of the human mind and developed a unifying philosophy of science. Comte's law was a progressive process. The human mind begins by seeking answers to its questions in theology. Mental development passes through a transition stage to a 'positive' or final state, where supernatural or abstract causes are rejected in favour of seeking answers through scientific laws. His accompanying philosophy of science was influential for decades after his death. Within the positivist framework, the interrelation of the various branches of sciences is maintained despite their increasing divergence and level of specialization.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

Huxley became a passionate adherent and defender of Charles Darwin and the concept of Evolution after reading Darwin's 'Origin of Species.' He famously defeated Archbishop Samuel Wilberforce in an 1860 debate on the Theory of Evolution. Huxley promoted the development of scientific education over religious traditions, coining the term 'agnostic' for his beliefs. He founded the X-Club in 1869 with a group of likeminded scientists and researchers. The X-Club would go on to found the scientific journal Nature in 1869, which still publishes today.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

pneumatic_drill_desc;The pneumatic drill is a mechanical drill driven by compressed air. Reciprocating pistons drive the compressed air upwards and down, propelling the drill bit into a surface and then drawing it out again. Pneumatic tools became preferred in the construction and operation of mining shafts and tunnels. Earlier tools had required steam power, and steam power required fire which was too dangerous due to the risk of igniting flammable gases underground. Larger pneumatic drilling machines utilized an external air compressor which could also help to ventilate the underground mines.;;;x;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x;

minie_ball_desc;The Minie ball is a conical-shaped bullet made of iron and soft lead. It was developed in 1849 by French army captain Claude-Etienne Minie based on the work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne. The Minie bullet solved the problem of designing ammunition for the new muzzle-loaded rifles. The bullet expanded to fit the tight rifling grooves when fired, allowing for a greater muzzle velocity and range of accuracy. The greater speed and weight of the Minie ball meant wounds were more severe and required more amputations as the bullets would tear straight through and shatter muscles, tendons, and bones;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

barbed_wire_desc;Barbed Wire was a late-nineteenth century American invention, used originally to keep herds of cattle fenced in. Barbed Wire became integrated with the trench systems of World War One as it was relatively easy to string up and often survived artillery bombardments and machine gun fire. The sharp barbs caused injury to attacking infantry. Emplacing rows of barbed wire in front of the trench line gave the machine gunners and field batteries time to decimate an attack while it was stuck cutting the wire.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

quick_firing_field_guns_desc;Quick-Firing Field Guns are breech-loaded artillery pieces that combine several characteristics to produce a high rate of fire. Buffer mechanisms and self-contained ammunition limited and then eliminated recoil of the barrel. Innovations in breech technology allowed for rapid reloading of the gun. One of an interrupted-screw or sliding-block system sealed the breech to conserve firing velocity. One of the most successful quick-firing designs was the French 'Canon de 75 modele 1897.' This 75mm piece could fire fifteen rounds per minute of high-explosive and shrapnel, devastating attacking infantry. Other nations quickly copied the technology.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
indirect_fire_techniques;Indirect Fire Techniques;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
indirect_fire_techniques_desc;Indirect fire involves aiming and firing artillery projectiles on targets not in a direct line of sight. The degree of accuracy achieved is dependent on calculations of the azimuth (an angular measurement of the target point relative to the reference point) and firing elevation of the gun.  The first practical manual was written in 1882 by a Russian officer, KG Guk. Guk described how to fix aiming points for firing arcs using geometry. The lack of a device to measure azimuth was solved in 1890 when Germany introduced the lining-plane. The lining-plane was mounted in-line with the bore and enabled the measurement of large angles. The effectiveness of indirect fire increased greatly with actual battlefield experience in the First World War. The introduction of airborne spotters in balloons and aircraft allowed for gun crews to correct their firing calculations during battles.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

social_democracy_desc;Democratic Socialism grew out of the revolutionary Socialist movement in the late Nineteenth Century. Some socialists remained revolutionary, and advocated the end of Market Capitalism in favor of complete state control of capital and the means of production. Social Democrats instead advocated the Social Welfare or 'Mixed Economy' state. In this version of Social Democracy, certain key services and industries might be nationalized, and the state would provide many social services and programs. However, market forces would continue to function. Political Parties advocating socialist policies, including the SPD in Germany and Labour in Brtain became powerful in the parliaments.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
marxism_leninism;Marxism-Leninism;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
marxism_leninism_desc;Marxism-Leninism was a further development of the Marxist theory described by Marx and Engels. As the name attests, it was originally propounded by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Lenin espoused the concept of the Vanguard Party. Marxist-Leninists rejected Democratic Socialism's peaceful, parliamentary path to socialism. They argued instead argued for immediate and violent revolution. Lenin wrote 'What is to Be Done?' in 1903, in which he described how a dedicated core of revolutionaries could take over in nations where a large, educated proletariat did not already exist. In 1917, Lenin launched a revolution in Russia with a mix of soldier, worker, and peasant support, where a collection of 'Soviets' unde the leadership of Lenin's revolutionary vanguard usurped and then replaced the functions of the traditional state authorities. Marxism-Leninism never realized the utopian withering away of the state as Marx had envisioned. The revolutionary Dictatorship of the Proletariat became a dominant social class of its own. Membership in the Communist Party meant a standard of living  and power above that of the 'proletariat' whom the revolution had been proclaimed for.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
national_socialism;National Socialism;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
national_socialism_desc;National Socialism was an extreme form of the ideology of Fascism, which grew out of global instability after the Great War. National Socialists started with the basic tenets of Fascism, including the Leadership Principle, the Police State, a mass movement, the suppression of Democratic institutions and the subordination of industry and labour to the state. They added ideas derived from social-Darwinism, Eugenics, and Ultranationalist thinkers. This produced a highly toxic and perverted ideology that promised to make the national community or 'Volk' healthy, strong, and dominant. Along with traditional racism towards non-whites, members of minority religions, Eastern European cultures, and especially the Jews were to be forcibly deported, encouraged to emigrate, sterilized, or simply exterminated.'Racial Science' determined them to be inferior not only socially and culturally, but also biologically. National Socialist or 'Nazi' movements primarily sprung up in 'Western' states in the first half of the Twentieth Century, though Japan developed its own theories of race akin to the Nordic 'Aryan' superman based on the 'Yamato' Culture. Communism was the great ideological enemy of the National Socialists;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

In practice this meant various measures of popular indoctrination, legal or violent repression of the political opposition, and varying levels of persecution against non-party social and religious groups.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
totalitarianism;Totalitarianism;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
totalitarianism_desc;The suppression of the basic institutions and rights of a democratic society became one of the first goals of Fascist and Communist states. Parliaments were abolished or made rubber stamps for state decrees and programs. Elections and Plebiscites (if held at all) were no longer secret-ballot: any citizens who opposed were virtually forced to vote the party line, or face punishment in prison or even in Gulags/Concentration Camps. The Press was censored, or more often became another state organ for the dissemination of propaganda extolling the regime's virtues and demonizing its enemies. Freedom of expression in academia, in the world of culture and in the public sphere was curtailed. Professors, scientists and professionals were willingly or unwillingly conscripted to serve the state's priorities. Many intellectuals became emigres and moved to other democratic nations, because to stay and refuse to serve meant incarceration or death.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

the_leadership_principle_desc;Fascism rejected assumptions that all were born with the ability to be leaders through popular revolution or election to democratic office. The 'Leadership Principle' affirmed that the state would be led by a group of individuals who were 'gifted to rule.' This introduced an appointed hierarchy in civil society which resembled that of the military. An Italian essay on the 'Doctrine of Fascism' stated: 'the conception of the State is all-embracing;;;;x;;;;;;;

ultranationalism_n_the_volk_desc;Ultranationalism encouraged a form of collectivism that unlike Marxism, emphasized national unity through ethnicity or 'race.' Fascists believed in a state free of class struggle, National organizations were formed for the various economic classes, who all worked for the benefit of the nation. This was known as Corporatism. National Socialist variants rejected definitions based on mere national 'feeling' or 'myth.' Their definitions of belonging were based on the lines of racial protectionism or racial supremacy;;;;x;;;;;;;
collectivisation;Collectivisation;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
collectivisation_desc;Marxist doctrine emphasized the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' whereby the workers would take control of the means of the production and ulimately own their own factories and farms in a utopian socialist vision of collectivism. The architects of Communist state ideology were inevitably unable to deliver this utopian vision. What resulted instead was a dramatic expansion of state economic planning and central control over all industries and industrial production. Housing and infrastructure projects also became state-owned and directed. Heavy industry was to be emphasized above consumer goods. Private ownership of land was largely ended, and early attempts at land redistribution became massive collectivization projects whereby huge farms were organized in a factory-like manner. As with factories, delivery of raw materials and production quotas were set by central planning agencies. In all of these areas, the inherent problems of deficiencies and impossible targets came to the fore.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
the_classless_society;The Classless Society;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
the_classless_society_desc;The coming to power of Communist movements usually meant that the 'intelligentsia' - academics, the political opposition, businessmen, aristocrats and large landowners, even army officers - were purged, driven into exile, or killed as being opposed to the revolution. The Communist state promoted the idea of the classless society, where everyone was a comrade in the service of the State. Organized religion and ethnic nationalism were often brutally suppressed, because they could provide foci for anti-regime activities and armed resistance. The armed forces were not only often deprived of leadership in purges, but traditional military symbols that inspired the army were removed in favour of empty Marxist slogans.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

Residents preferred to move out of the city and live in the suburbs, thus depriving the city of tax revenues. In 1865 the architect Leon-Pierre Suys presented a plan to divert the Senne through specially constructed tunnels under the centre of the city. The exposed riverbed would be covered over and a series of 4 grand boulevards were to be laid out. Construction started in 1867 and was completed in 1871. While the new buildings failed to attract suburban residents back to the city, public health was measurably improved and transport congestion eased.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTDESC200001;For some years now, the Boers have left our South African colonies and formed states of their own. We regard these 'Boer Republics' as being in our sphere of influence and control.The Boer populations however have a fierce streak of independence and resist all foreign attempts to influence them. Lingering issues over the treatment and political rights of non-Boer whites in these republics is a perennial source of tension between the Adminstration in Capetown and the Boer leaders.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTNAME21530;Yellow River Flood of 1851;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC21530;The Mandate of Heaven was a belief held by the Chinese of the right for the Manchu house to rule China. As long as the ruler was upright and virtuous, Heaven was appeased. If the ruler became wicked and corrupt, then Heaven would withdraw its Mandate and make it known to the people through disasters. In 1851, the Yellow River breached the north embankment near Kaifeng Prefecture in Henan and caused great devastation over the countryside of North China. It required some fifteen or more years to repair damages from this outbreak, and to confine the stream with new embankments. These disasters were indication to the Chinese people that the Manchurians were losing the Mandate of Heaven, the right to rule and govern China.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

The system of dykes and levees previouisly maintained to control river flooding has failed. Extensive loss of life and damage to crops and buildings has been reported. The flooding spread throughout the North China Plain. Everywhere, voices murmured that the Qing Emperor was losing his Mandate from Heaven, the divine right to rule. Discontent began to spread everywhere.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTNAME21540;Yellow River Flood of 1887;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC21540;The Yellow River changed course in 1855, emptying into the Yellow Sea north of the Shandong Peninsula rather than to the south of it. In 1887 a rising river coupled with a prolonged period of heavy rain caused the river to first burst through dikes near Zhengzhou, in Henan province. The river subsequently flooded the plains of North China much as it had done in 1855, causing massive deaths, and bringing disease and famine in its wake.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

The flooding is reported to have begun near Zhengzhou, in the Henan province. Destruction and loss of life once more envelop the North China Plain. The flooding river has changed its course since 1851, now emptying into the Yellow Sea north of the Shandong province and bringing its catastrophic effects closer to the capital.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTDESC21550;China suffered a prolonged drought from 1928 until 1930. Through the end of 1930 and into 1931, abnormally heavy winter snowstorms and spring/summer rains once more caused the Yellow River to rise significantly, flooding over its banks. The Yangtzee and Huai rivers would also later flood their banks as well, affecting over 28 million people.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTNAME44825;The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC44825;With our northern lands under American control, it seems we have little choice but to negotiate. The Americans have offered us a deal: the normalization of relations, the forgiveness of our debt and the payment of a great deal of money... all in exchange for the relinquishment of our claims to all territories north of the Rio Grande.

EVTNAME1010011;The Great Irish Famine;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTNAME1010015;The Young Irelander Rebellion;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
