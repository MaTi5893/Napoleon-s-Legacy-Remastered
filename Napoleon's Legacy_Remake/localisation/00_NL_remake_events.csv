EVTDESC10001;While Napoleon's war machine has halted, the fundamental ideas of the French Revolution are still going strong everywhere. In Germany the old crowns of the Holy Roman Empire have been wrought to naught, and the feudal contracts of old replaced by Napoleonic civil codes. Everywhere in Europe, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles on Waterloo, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;Aunque Napoleón y sus ejércitos han sido derrotados, las ideas fundamentales de la Revolución Francesa perduran. En Alemania, no queda nada de las viejas coronas del Sacro Imperio Romano, y los antiguos contratos feudales son sustituidos por códigos civiles napoleónicos. En toda Europa, desde cafés a universidades, las ideas del liberalismo, la reforma política, la libertad de expresión y los derechos de las gentes en vez de los de sus monarcas demuestran el viejo proverbio de que nada puede detener una idea cuando llega su momento. Las minorías que durante mucho tiempo han estado subyugadas bajo las coronas y los cetros, están empezando a darse cuenta de que de ellas depende la consecución de su destino y, más allá de los océanos, les esperan las riquezas de África y Asia. Mientras el polvo se asienta en Waterloo, Europa se levanta de nuevo al inicio de una nueva era: una época de liberalismo.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME600023;The Emperor's Council influence grows!;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC600023;As the emperor Napoleon fell into madness, his best generals and wife decided to create a presonnal council to make sure the country was running. With time, it grew in power and now the emperor's political power is a shadow of what it was.
