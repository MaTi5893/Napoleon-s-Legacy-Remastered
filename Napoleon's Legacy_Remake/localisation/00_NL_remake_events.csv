EVTDESC10001;While Napoleon's war machine has halted, the fundamental ideas of the French Revolution are still going strong everywhere. In Germany the old crowns of the Holy Roman Empire have been wrought to naught, and the feudal contracts of old replaced by Napoleonic civil codes. Everywhere in Europe, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles on Waterloo, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;Aunque Napoleón y sus ejércitos han sido derrotados, las ideas fundamentales de la Revolución Francesa perduran. En Alemania, no queda nada de las viejas coronas del Sacro Imperio Romano, y los antiguos contratos feudales son sustituidos por códigos civiles napoleónicos. En toda Europa, desde cafés a universidades, las ideas del liberalismo, la reforma política, la libertad de expresión y los derechos de las gentes en vez de los de sus monarcas demuestran el viejo proverbio de que nada puede detener una idea cuando llega su momento. Las minorías que durante mucho tiempo han estado subyugadas bajo las coronas y los cetros, están empezando a darse cuenta de que de ellas depende la consecución de su destino y, más allá de los océanos, les esperan las riquezas de África y Asia. Mientras el polvo se asienta en Waterloo, Europa se levanta de nuevo al inicio de una nueva era: una época de liberalismo.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME600023;The Emperor's Council influence grows!;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC600023;As the emperor Napoleon fell into madness, his best generals and wife decided to create a presonnal council to make sure the country was running. With time, it grew in power and now the emperor's political power is a shadow of what it was. Keeping this council temporarily will help us administrate our country, but we should be careful of their ambitions - who knows what they might be planning?;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x

EVTDESC36898;On the 28th of June, 1838, princess Alexandrina Victoria of House Hanover ascended to the throne of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as 'Queen Victoria'. Her reign, which would last even a few years into the 20th century, would later be remembered as the absolute zenith of the British Empire, upon which the sun never set. Today a jubilant crowd in London has escorted the young Queen Victoria to her residence in the newly built Buckingham Palace.;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC600034;When the British Commonwealth proclaimed its independence with both Dutch and British colonies the localisation of the capital was always a question.

EVTNAME600042;Imperialism or Isolasionism?;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
EVTDESC600042;The United States of America have always had an ambigious relation with Europe. While we are making most of our money from trade with Europe and shared a lot of ideology with the old continent, we have always had a different approach on colonisalism as a former colony. It's also important to note that the recent conflict against european power have pushed us to take a decision on our foreign diplomacy. Should we focus on America and renounce the idea of imperialism or should we embrace our european heritage ?;;;;Spanish Loc;;;x
