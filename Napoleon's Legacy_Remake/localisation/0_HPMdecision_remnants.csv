create_rhodesia_desc;The British South Africa Company's administration of what became Rhodesia was chartered in 1889 by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, and began with the Pioneer Column's march north-east to Mashonaland. Empowered by its charter to acquire, govern and develop the area north of the Transvaal in southern Africa, the Company, headed by Cecil Rhodes, raised its own armed forces and carved out a huge bloc of territory through treaties, concessions and occasional military action, most prominently overcoming the Matabele army in the Matabele Wars. \n\n By the turn of the century, Rhodes' Company held a vast, land-locked country, bisected by the Zambezi river. It officially named this land Rhodesia in honour of Cecil Rhodes.;;;x

support_french_foreign_legion_desc;'La Legion Etrangere', known in English as 'The Foreign Legion', is a military unit of the French army, with a unique distinction in that it accepts its recruits regardless of their national and personal backgrounds. While originally established as early as 1830, the Legion did not win the lasting legacy it enjoys today until it had seen action during, among others, The Spanish Carlist Wars, The French Intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camaron, the Franco-Prussian war and, in fact, almost every conflict involving France up until and through the modern era. The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century. Promote the Legion, and see recruits flock to our banners.;;;x

search_for_aegean_civilizations_desc;Interest has been growing in the academic community about the fate of the so-called "Aegean Civilizations" and especially the location of the ancient city of Troy.

claim_negusa_nagast_title;Claim the Imperial Throne;;;x
claim_negusa_nagast_desc;The Solomonic dynasty is a puppet in Gonder and Ethiopia carries on divided. This era, known as the Zemene Mesafint or the 'Age of Princes', has warlords, regional princes, and noble houses vying with each other for power and control. They divided the Empire into personal fiefs and fought each other continuously. A puppet Emperor of the dynasty was enthroned in Gonder by one warlord, only to be dethroned and replaced by another member of the Imperial dynasty when a different warlord was able to seize Gonder and the reins of power. Regions such as Gojjam and Shewa were ruled by their own branches of the Imperial dynasty and, in Shewa, the local prince went as far as assuming the title of King. Now it's our time to try and seize the moment, to claim the title of King, to march on Gonder and all of Ethiopia and to try and bring an end to the infighting, to make Ethiopia whole once more.;;;x
