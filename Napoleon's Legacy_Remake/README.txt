Info: 
	This is a 'what if Napoleon won?' alternate history scenario, based on IGoR PUIR (an mp mod you can find here https://github.com/Nurse-Reno/IGoR_puir)
	Some of the more interesting countries to play would be:  
	Westphalia
	Royaume d'Italie (Napoleonic Italy)
        Mexico

Installation: Open your Victoria 2 game files
(if you bought the game on Steam, right click on it in your library, click on properties, then on 'browse local files'), 
open the NLR zip file, 
copy the Napoleon's Legacy Remake folder and Napoleon's Legacy Remake .mod file to the /mod folder in your game files.

Delete the Documents/Paradox Interactive/Victoria II/Napoleon's Legacy Remake/map folder if region borders look weird
