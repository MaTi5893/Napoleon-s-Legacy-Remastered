The lore of the mod : 
https://github.com/elisandreo/Napoleon-s-Legacy-Remastered/tree/main/Napoleon's%20Legacy_Remake/Napoleon's-Europe.md


Info: 
	This is a 'what if Napoleon won?' alternate history scenario, based on IGoR PUIR (an mp mod you can find here https://github.com/Nurse-Reno/IGoR_puir)
	Some of the more interesting countries to play would be:  
        Mexico
	Spain
	Austria
	Greece
	

Installation: Open your Victoria 2 game files
(if you bought the game on Steam, right click on it in your library, click on properties, then on 'browse local files'), 
open the NLR zip file, 
copy the Napoleon's Legacy Remake folder and Napoleon's Legacy Remake .mod file to the /mod folder in your game files.

###The NLR Low Res submod changes the terrain textures to be smaller, so that they have less an impact on performance, while still looking... passable, to me.###					    ##
###The Belle Dark submod is a graphics change, using Jman's Belle Dark mapmod.										      ###
##Neither of the submods change your checksum - they're purely graphical										      ##
#If you don't want to keep having to click more than one option in the launcher, you can just copy the files of a submod into the main mod folder. 	      #

The Victoria 2 Modding Server and all the people in it: for all the help. By the way, to any modders: you're free to take parts of this mod and do your own thing with it. Even the PUIR parts, I'm sure all the 4 currently absent PUIR developers won't care about you taking their code. It'd be cool if you didn't take the entire mod and reupload it under your own name, but I don't know why you'd want to do that in the first place.
