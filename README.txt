###The NLR Low Res submod changes the terrain textures to be smaller, therefore saving on performance and RAM usage, while still looking... passable, to me.###
##You need to enable both the submod and NLR itself in the launcher. The submod does not change the checksum.						    ##
#I'm not sure if there will be any further submods, this one is just a thing because I know some people might not like that the terrain looks worse.	    #


Info: 
	This is a 'what if Napoleon won?' alternate history scenario, based on IGoR PUIR (an mp mod you can find here https://github.com/Nurse-Reno/IGoR_puir)
	Some of the more interesting countries to play would be:  
        Mexico
	Spain
	Austria
	Greece

Installation: Open your Victoria 2 game files
(if you bought the game on Steam, right click on it in your library, click on properties, then on 'browse local files'), 
open the NLR zip file, 
copy the Napoleon's Legacy Remake folder and Napoleon's Legacy Remake .mod file to the /mod folder in your game files.

Delete the Documents/Paradox Interactive/Victoria II/Napoleon's Legacy Remake/map folder if region borders look weird
